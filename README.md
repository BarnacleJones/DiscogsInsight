# DiscogsInsight
.NET Maui Blazor application designed for getting insights into your discogs collection data. 

Created to play around with MAUI/Blazor, SQLite, MAUI DataGrids and to visualise data about my vinyl collection. 

This application uses a discogs username to fetch information about your discogs collection and store it locally to let you explore your collection. 
Over time the application will become quicker as your artist and release data is fetched and stored locally as you request the information the first time.

To run, ensure you have all SDKs for .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid development. Note: attached photos may not be current.

You will need a discogs username for fetching your collection. This is entered when you first open the application, or via the settings page to change it.

ONce this is entered your collection will be seeded to the database and you can then use the navigation menu to explore:
